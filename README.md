PLEASE NOTE: this app relies on an external API which is limited to 100 requests per day due to me using a free account. 

The app still functions when the API limit is reached but will not load any of the players or game history on the home page if this limit is reached. This limit resets a 00:00 UTC every day.

This limit will only be reached from restarting the app repeatedly or changing the spinner year too often. (Each time the app is openeed or spinner is used thats 2x requests)
