I think my project demonstrated effective use of core Android SDK components, including SharedPreferences for persistent user settings (favourite team selection), AlarmManager for in-app scheduling of notifications, and BroadcastReceivers to handle push notifications. Network status was handled via connectivity checks to ensure a smooth user experience, and the app supported both English and Welsh using Android's resource qualifiers. Dynamic content was rendered throughout, contributing to an interactive and responsive UI.

However, the initial scope of the project I set out was overly ambitious relative to available development time. This led to reduced feature completeness compared to the original pitch, particularly around statistics displays and content. Time management and task prioritisation were key weaknesses. I think adopting Agile methodologies, such as defining a clear MVP and using tools for sprint planning, would have improved my delivery focus.

Android Studio posed recurring challenges, particularly with Gradle syncs and emulator instability. Better environment familiarity, along with the use of automated testing and CI tools, could have increased my efficiency. While not all intended features were fully developed, the project achieved a technically diverse implementation and provided a strong experience with Android Studio and the Android SDK.
