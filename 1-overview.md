I aim to develop a National Football League (NFL) 'Superfan' app, with a target user base of British-based american football fans. This app will facilitate users the abilitity to view a number of statistics related to the sport, have quizzes for fans to test their 'ball knowledge', news stories to keep fans up to date with whats happening in the sport outside of the games and push notifications to let a user know when a games about to start. Statistics such as scheduled game dates and times (in their local timezone), game results and statistics, team statistics, players etc. will all be displayed as apart of this system and will allow users to get on-demand accurate information whenever they need. The implementation of quizzes can be a fun way for users to test their knowledge of the NFL season against friends. The implementation of news stories mean fans will never miss out on news like a big player signing or coach changes. Finally the push notifications for when games start mean fans who might have forgotten about the game can be reminded.

This is a nice idea for an app. I can see quite a few ways that you could demonstrate your knowledge of the Android SDK with this. Here are some thoughts:

- Is your target group 'superfans'?
- What does your MVP look like for this? You're quite ambitious here in terms of the functionality of the app. What is the critical functionality here? What's the priority? (And it's important here to balance showing your skills with the Android SDK with having authentic functionality in the app.)
- Remember that in terms of content production, you don't want to spend loads of time here. So for your quizzes – spending a bunch of time researching and developing a question bank might get you a couple of scholarship marks. But ultimately it doesn't demonstrate any Android skills and so we'd be a bit limited in terms of giving marks. (Especially as doing it lots of times doesn't demonstrate a new skill, just a repetition of one.)
- More generally, where will the data be sourced from? An API? Is it reliable? If not, how are you going to convincingly mock all of this data without sinking lots of time into it? Worth thinking about what is going to be in the app when we come to mark it, to ensure that all of the features you've implemented are obvious to us.

Hope these comments are helpful. Let me know if you'd like to discuss.
