I aim to develop a National Football League (NFL) 'Superfan' app, with a target user base of British-based american football fans. This app will facilitate users the abilitity to view a number of statistics related to the sport, have quizzes for fans to test their 'ball knowledge', news stories to keep fans up to date with whats happening in the sport outside of the games and push notifications to let a user know when a games about to start. Statistics such as scheduled game dates and times (in their local timezone), game results and statistics, team statistics, players etc. will all be displayed as apart of this system and will allow users to get on-demand accurate information whenever they need. The implementation of quizzes can be a fun way for users to test their knowledge of the NFL season against friends. The implementation of news stories mean fans will never miss out on news like a big player signing or coach changes. Finally the push notifications for when games start mean fans who might have forgotten about the game can be reminded.
